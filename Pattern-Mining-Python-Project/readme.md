# **Frequent Itemset Mining Using FP-Growth Algorithm**  

## **Project Overview**  
This project aims to identify **frequent itemsets** in large datasets using the **FP-Growth (Frequent Pattern Growth) algorithm**. Frequent itemset mining is a fundamental step in **association rule mining**, which helps uncover valuable patterns in transactional datasets. The project dynamically determines the minimum support threshold based on the dataset's **skewness** to improve the effectiveness of frequent item discovery.  

## **Algorithms Used**  
### 1. **FP-Growth Algorithm**  
   - Unlike the Apriori algorithm, FP-Growth does not require candidate generation.  
   - It uses a **compact tree structure (FP-tree)** to store transactions efficiently.  
   - Frequent itemsets are extracted by recursively mining the tree structure.  

### 2. **Dynamic Minimum Support Calculation**  
   - The **skewness of the dataset** is used to decide whether to use the mean or median for threshold determination.  
   - If skewness is between **-1 and 1**, the **mean and standard deviation** are used.  
   - Otherwise, the **median and interquartile range (IQR)** are used.  

### 3. **Support and Association Rule Mining**  
   - The support of each itemset is calculated to identify **frequent itemsets**.  
   - **Association rules** are generated based on **confidence** and **lift** measures.

## **Dataset Used**  
- **Dataset Name**: `groceries-trimmed.csv` (Kaggle)  
- **Description**:  
  - A **transactional dataset** where each row represents a shopping transaction.  
  - Items are represented as **strings** in each transaction.  
  - No predefined columns since the number of items per transaction varies.  

---

## **Project Workflow**  

### **1. Data Preprocessing**  
- Load the `groceries-trimmed.csv` dataset.  
- Convert all items into **string format** for consistency.  
- Transform the dataset into a **list of transactions**.  

### **2. Encoding Transactions**  
- Convert transactions into a **binary matrix**, where:  
  - `1` indicates the presence of an item in a transaction.  
  - `0` indicates the absence of the item.  

### **3. Skewness Calculation**  
- Skewness is measured to determine the distribution of item frequencies.  
- If skewness is between **-1 and 1**, the mean is used; otherwise, the median is used.  

### **4. Dynamic Minimum Support Calculation**  
- Support threshold is computed using **mean & standard deviation** or **median & IQR** based on the skewness value.  
- Helps in setting an **adaptive** and **optimal** minimum support threshold.  

### **5. Frequent Itemset Mining (FP-Growth Algorithm)**  
- The FP-Growth algorithm is applied to find **frequent itemsets** using the computed minimum support.  

### **6. Filtering and Threshold Adjustments**  
- Itemsets are grouped by their length.  
- Thresholds are recalculated dynamically for different lengths.  

### **7. Association Rule Mining**  
- Generate **association rules** from frequent itemsets.  
- Rules are filtered based on:  
  - **Minimum confidence (‚â• 0.8)**  
  - **Minimum lift (‚â• 3.0)**  

### **8. Result Display**  
- Display the frequent itemsets and their support values.  
- Print **final association rules** with support, confidence, and lift values.  
- Measure **total execution time**.
