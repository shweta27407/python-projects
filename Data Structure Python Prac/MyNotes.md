1. Loop inside loop = n * n = n^2
2. Ex :  8 nos in array, 3 steps to find the number in array
            2^3 = 8
            log_2(8) = 3
3. O(a) + O(b) = O(a + b)
4. O(n^2) = Loop inside a loop , 
    O(n) = Proportional
    O(log n) = Divide and Conquer
    O(1) = constant

## LinkedList
1. spread out in different places in memory, not contiguous, so doesn't have indexes
2. Add or remove element
    remove at end - O(1)
    add at end - O(n)
    add at front - O(1)
    remove at front - O(1)
    add at middle - O(n)
    remove at middle - O(n)
3.  Lookup element
    looking up by value or index - O(n)
